# Classifying between Broached and Unbroached Mechanical Equipment with above 96% accuracy

Here, we use Keras, an high level neural network Library for classify Dog vs cat images from kaggle data-set.
For more description :- https://medium.com/@parthvadhadiya424/hello-world-program-in-keras-with-cnn-dog-vs-cat-classification-efc6f0da3cc5



## Prerequisites

NumPy==1.13.1 -: sudo pip3 install numpy 

Keras==2.0.6  -: https://keras.io/



## Usage

Untitled.ipynb contains hello world program in keras(simpler example)

firstly download data-set from :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data

python3 pre.py responsible for preprocessing of data-set

python3 model.py is for build and train model.

python3 use_model.py use for predict new images.

if you dont want to train just run python3 use_model.py . you will get output with my pretrained model.
